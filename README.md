This is a dynamic prayer Calendar that show all of the prayers and Jamaa'ah times of one month and you can change the month and year to any you want.

This App uses an Api from [Prayers Times API](https://aladhan.com/prayer-times-api) that gives you all the data of prayes times based on different params, In this app we have used this EndPoint API: http://api.aladhan.com/v1/calendar/:year/:month?latitude={location-latitude}&longitude={location-longitude}&method=2.

The method param used in the end represents the school of thought you want to get the times in, In this case method=2 represents Islamic Society of North America school of thought!
